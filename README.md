# Personal Statement
Alien Love is a dating simulator that explores the concept of "love" through an alien's point of view. Your main goal is to find different partners to better understand how humans think about love. In this game, there's a total of five possible love interests you can choose from; fifteen endings in total. After going through each one, you soon discover that every love option leads to your character having no sort of infatuation with any of the five characters. The reason for this choice is to express the life of someone who is Aromantic and/or Asexual, or anyone who falls under these umbrellas.
Within love simulators, contemporary games have provided plenty of options over time for people to choose different genders, orientations, and love interests of all types. However, most fail to understand how people who may follow under the Aromantic and/or Asexual umbrella tend to be forgotten or lazily done in video games, where you don't find any interest in simple endings. For Alien Love, I wanted to explore the depths of what it can be realistically. When it comes to Aromantic/Asexual, it's not an obvious answer for most to discover these terms; it's not widely talked about compared to most orientations. I attempted to collect a variety of scenarios people experience during these confusing periods, and how not understanding your feelings completely can lead to these results. There is a heart system on whether or not that character likes an answer; if answered wrong, you lose a heart. Having at least one heart leads you to the final two decisions. In this statement, I’ll discuss the three routes and the endings connected: Nikita, Kagami, and Draven.
To start, Nikita is a character you can choose if you go to the rock concert, and she comes off as aggressive, loud, stubborn, and harsh. In the crowd, you run into her, and there are noticeable features about her. If you can have one heart at least, you go through the dialogue to the point where she tries to put herself onto you with clear implications for intimate acts. Depending on the two choices, you can either go along with her with a bit of confusion about what it meant, or you can tell the truth and stop her. If you go about being with her and lying to yourself, this leads to an ending where you’re not sure how you feel about it, and you involve yourself in a vague, intimate act with her just for the night. Nikita kicks you out of the hotel room since there are traces that she was on some sort of alcohol or drug, causing her to do this and forget the next morning. If you tell her the truth and turn her down, she gets upset with you because you didn’t want to give her what she wanted, so she kicks you out. These choices are on purpose and align with my ideas for this game. I wanted this route to show the somewhat realistic scenario of some trying to peer-pressure a person into intimate activities. Regardless of the decision, some people or you don’t understand your feelings, and it can lead to a lose-lose situation no matter what you choose to do. It’s not implying that every person is like this, but there are times this happens, which brings up another route.
Next, there’s Kagami’s route if you decide to choose the carnival route. Her personality going through the story is fun, bubbly, childish, and clingy. You meet her just running into her, but she has a dilemma about finding her friends. Of course, you help her, and if you can pass through with at least one heart, she takes you on a Ferris wheel to spend alone time. Kagami mentions her romantic intentions towards you compared to Nikita, who had more intimate intentions towards you. Similar to Nikita, you can either choose to lie and go along with it, or you can tell her the truth that you don’t feel the same way. While her reaction is different, she gets embarrassed for admitting her feelings and mentions that she is a hopeless romantic who wants to feel love. These options give the same outcome, but are slightly different from each other. Playtesters have mentioned they feel bad for both endings when it comes to her, and that’s what I wanted to go for. It’s never easy to be truthful, and lying can make the situation worse.
Finally, another route I want to mention is Draven’s route if you go to the cafe. You’re introduced to Draven, who comes off as outgoing, calm, confident, and chill. Once you make the right choices with one heart, at least, it cuts down the two of you spend constantly seeing each other. You become close until he suggests dating you. However, the options here are different because telling him the truth leads to him understanding your decision and still staying friends. This ending, where you lie to him, however, will lead to that trust you built with him becoming uneasy because you pretend to feel some romantic/intimate feelings. He discovers this over time, and it ends without a rekindling of a friendship. This shows clearly the impact of telling the truth is important not only to yourself, but the other person, to avoid trust being broken in the process.
While play-testers thought the different endings were all fails, the ending where you go back to your colony shows the final summary of what you have learned from each person. You’re given quotes for each lesson learned, and they get a better understanding of what this game means once they get to the very end.
During development, I had to make lots of changes to the heart system to give some challenge, limiting the character’s stories to turn it in on time, and condensing the cast from 8 characters to 5. To me, this is a form of art and activism of a topic I feel is undermined in media, especially games. This game is a mockery of dating simulators, but for a good cause that expresses a demographic of those who identify with Aromantic and/or Asexual, and any under this umbrella.
